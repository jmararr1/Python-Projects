# Python-Projects
Repository for my first Python projects

- Bot gimnasio.

  My university's gym is very popular, and people book their slot when they become available, that is every Saturday at 10:00.
  That's why I did this, so I can have my slot.
  
  Software requirements:
  
  1) Have python installed.
  2) Have selenium installed.
  3) Have chromedriver.exe in the C:\ folder.

  The code has some comments that act as an user guide.
  
  The only remark that I ought to do is the following:
   
  The last step is clicking the slot you want, that's something that you have to tell the program.
  The page where you select your slots is basically a matrix of links. I'll call them buttons as that's how they are referred to in the code.
  
  You also have to take into account that if you are enrrolled in another activity, its cancel button also counts as a button. This means that, when you book a slot, a new button   appears, and the buttons[] list has to be updated.
  
  I leave that task to everyone who wants to use this code :)
