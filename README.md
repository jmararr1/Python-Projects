# Python-Projects
Repository for my first Python projects

- Bot gimnasio.

  My university's gym is very popular, and people book their slot when they become available, that is every Saturday at 10:00.
  That's why I did this, so I can have my slot.
  
  Software requirements:
  
  1) Have python installed.
  2) Have selenium installed.
  3) Have chromedriver.exe in the C:\ folder.

  For help, execute the command with -h (py gimnasio_reserva.py -h)
